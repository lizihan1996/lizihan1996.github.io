      <h1>Detection of Image Splicing Used in Field of View Expansion(In Progress)</h1>
      <p><b>Image splicing is a common technology used both in image tampering and large FOV imaging with multi cameras. In this project, I plan not only to distinguish a photo is spliced or not, but also evaluate the level of distortion. For further study, this project can serve as the feedback of a image splicing system or a parameter of image quality evaluation.</b></p>

      <h1>Study on the MTF Method of Medical Endoscopy</h1>
      <p><b>Modulation transfer function (MTF) is considered to be a concise and objective evaluation parameter for most of optical devices. To measure the MTF of medical video endoscope, a method based on knife-edge method is designed. In the research, the imaging qualities of three different endoscopes are tested and analyzed carefully, which can effectively support the correction of the MTF measurement method designed.</b></p>
