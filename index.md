      <h1>Detection of Image Splicing Used in Field of View Expansion(In Progress)</h1>
      <p><b>Image splicing is a common technology used both in image tampering and large FOV imaging with multi cameras. In this project, I plan not only to distinguish a photo is spliced or not, but also evaluate the level of distortion. For further study, this project can serve as the feedback of a image splicing system or a parameter of image quality evaluation.</b></p>
